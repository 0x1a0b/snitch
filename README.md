# Snitch

A simple tool that collects TODOs in the source code and reports them as GitHub issues.

## How it works

1. Snitch finds an unreported TODO,
2. Reports it to the GitHub as an issue,
3. Assigns the Issue number to the TODO marking it a reported,
4. Commits the reported TODO to the git repo,
5. Repeats the process until all of the unreported TODOs are reported.

After that you are supposed to push the new reported TODOs yourself.

## TODO Format

### Unreported TODO

#### Example

```
// TODO: rewrite this in Rust
```

#### Parsing

Regular expression: `^(.*)TODO: (.*)$` [Play](https://regex101.com/r/u5lkxf/2)

Capture Groups:
- Group 1: **Prefix**. Used only to precisly recover the text of the line where the TODO is originally located.
- Group 2: **Suffix**. Used as the title of the issue.

### Reported TODO

#### Example

```
// TODO(#42): rewrite this in Rust
```

#### Parsing

Regular expression: `^(.*)TODO\((.*)\): (.*)$` [Play](https://regex101.com/r/5U6rjS/1)

Capture Groups:
- Group 1: **Prefix**. Used only to precisly recover the text of the line where the TODO is originally located.
- Group 2: **ID**. The number of the Issue.
- Group 3: **Suffix**. Used as the title of the issue.

### TODO Body

#### Example

```
// TODO: rewrite this in Rust
//   I honestly think Rust is going to be around forever,
//   I really do. I think this is like, this is the formation
//   of Ancient Greek.
//   Â© https://www.reddit.com/r/programmingcirclejerk/comments/ahmnwa/i_honestly_think_rust_is_going_to_be_around/
```

#### Parsing

- Snitch remembers the TODO's prefix.
- Snitch parses all of the consecutive lines with the same prefix as the body.
- The body is reported as the Issue Description.

## Installation

```console
$ go get github.com/tsoding/snitch
```

## Usage

```console
$ snitch list                         # lists all TODOs in the current dir
$ snitch report [--body <issue-body>] # report all unreported TODOs in the current dir
$ snitch purge <owner/repo>           # remove TODOs that refer to closed issues
```

## .snitch.yaml

### Custom keywords

You don't have to use `TODO` as the keyword of a todo you want to
"snitch up". The keyword is customizable through `.snitch.yaml`
config:

```yaml
keywords:
  - TODO
  - FIXME
  - XXX
  - "@todo"
```

### Issue Title Transformation

You can apply project local issue title transformations. Create
`.snich.yaml` file in the root of the project with the following
content:

```yaml
title:
  transforms:
    - match: (.*) \*/
      replace: $1
```

This feature is very useful for removing garbage from the Issue
Titles. Like `*/` at the end of C comments.

## GitHub Credentials File

Resides in `$HOME/.snitch/github.ini`

### Format

```ini
[github]
personal_token = <personal-token>
```

Checkout [GitHub Help][personal-token] on how to get the Personal Access Token.

Make sure to enable full access to private repos. For some reason it's required to post issues.
